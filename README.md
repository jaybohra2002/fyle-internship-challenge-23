# Fyle Frontend Challenge
I have created different components in order to differentiate and have a clean code/logic for the consumer of the repo. 
I have showcased data binding, interaction between components, API usage and Data manipulation in the following angular project.

## Instructions to Run:
Install Angular 14+ on your system, Clone this repo and run using the command "ng serve" on your CLI

## Unit test:
I have written unit test for search component, and API service. Use "ng test" command to test the same on karma.

### Install requirements
* Install angular cli [Ref](https://angular.io/cli)
* `npm install` in this repository 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Further help

Visit the [Angular Documentation](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide) to learn more.
Styling is to be strictly done with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).
